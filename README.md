# Consumer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing consumer shopping behavior to uncover meaningful insights that support business decision-making. The analysis aims to understand purchasing patterns, customer segments, and factors influencing revenue, loyalty, and engagement.

An end-to-end data analytics workflow was implemented using Python for data preparation, SQL (Google BigQuery) for analysis, and Power BI for visualization.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level shopping information, including demographics, purchase amounts, product categories, discounts, reviews, shipping preferences, and subscription status.

Two versions of the dataset are maintained in this repository:
- **Raw data**: Original dataset without any modifications  
- **Cleaned data**: Processed and analysis-ready dataset

## Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python – Google Colab)

The raw dataset was uploaded to Google Colab and cleaned using Python. The following steps were performed:

- Removed duplicate records  
- Handled missing values using appropriate imputation methods  
- Renamed columns to `snake_case` for consistency and readability  
- Created derived features such as `age_category`  
- Ensured correct data types and validated data integrity  

The cleaned dataset was exported and used for further analysis.

## Data Analysis (SQL – Google BigQuery)

The cleaned dataset was loaded into Google BigQuery to perform analytical queries using SQL. The analysis focused on answering the following business questions:

1. Total revenue generated by male vs. female customers  
2. Customers who used discounts but spent more than the average purchase amount  
3. Top 5 products with the highest average review ratings  
4. Comparison of average purchase amounts between Standard and Express shipping  
5. Spending behavior of subscribed vs. non-subscribed customers  
6. Products with the highest percentage of discounted purchases  
7. Customer segmentation into New, Returning, and Loyal groups  
8. Top 3 most purchased products within each category  
9. Relationship between repeat purchases and subscription likelihood  
10. Revenue contribution by age group  

All SQL queries are included in the repository for reference and reproducibility.

## Visualization and Dashboard (Power BI)

The analytical results were visualized using Power BI through an interactive dashboard designed for business users.

### Dashboard Highlights
- Key metrics such as average purchase amount, total customers, and average review rating  
- Revenue and sales analysis by category, age group, and gender  
- Subscription and customer behavior insights  
- Interactive slicers for subscription status, gender, and shipping method  

The dashboard enables intuitive exploration of trends and supports data-driven decisions.
